This is a repository I use as a sandbox while studying game programming. My idea was to develop a project structure which would contain:

* An automated build environment based on CMake.
* A lazy implementation of a game engine based mostly on existing library (currently abuses the Pimpl idiom a lot).
* Automated tests based on Catch2.
* A set of small "games" built on the above engine which try to address a certain topic of the stuff I end up studying.

The idea is to have a practice framework in place which expands with time. It's supposed to be for self learning and improvement, so I doubt you'll find anything useful for you strictly. Also it's supposed to be filled with errors and bad practice which I try to improve over time. Still, be free to browse it.

* SFML
* Catch2
